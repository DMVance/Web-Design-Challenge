# Web-Design-Challenge

Website Summary

The website consists of 7 pages:

A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project.

Links to each visualization page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page to easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid shows two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table is a bootstrap table component.
The data comes from converting it from CSV to HTML using pandas.

Separated the <style> elements into a new file called "styles.css".

Used Bootstrap to simplify styling.
